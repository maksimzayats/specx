A FastAPI + Django + Celery project template for teams that want Django's ORM
and admin, FastAPI's async delivery, and a clean application structure from the
first commit.

## Start

Recommended: create your own repository from this template on GitHub, clone it,
then use the top-level [PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md](PROMPT_TEMPLATE.md) as the setup
interface:

1. Replace the bracketed values in the prompt template.
2. Remove any removable capability bullets you do not want.
3. Paste the edited prompt into an LLM coding agent working in your checkout.

The agent should rename the project and Python package, write environment files,
update docs and examples, remove omitted capabilities, refresh the lockfile, and
run validation checks. Keep the modern-python-template Base in the prompt:
FastAPI, Django ORM/admin, dependency injection, architecture guardrails, tests,
linting, and typing are the template's mandatory foundation.

If you clone the original template directly instead, use:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maksimzayats/modern-python-template.git your-project
cd your-project
```

In that flow, tell the agent whether to reinitialize Git and which `origin` URL
to set for the generated project.

## Run Locally

For a generated project that keeps local PostgreSQL, Redis, and filesystem
storage:

```bash
uv sync --locked --all-groups
docker compose up -d postgres redis
make migrate
make collectstatic
make dev
```

The API runs at `http://localhost:8000`, interactive API docs are at `/docs`,
and Django admin is mounted at `/django/admin/`.

If your edited prompt removes Redis, Celery, MinIO, S3, or other infrastructure,
use the generated README and `.env` values from the agent-led setup as the source
of truth for which services to start.

## What You Get

- FastAPI delivery with Django mounted for admin and Django URLs.
- Django ORM, migrations, authentication, admin, and typed settings.
- Celery worker and beat entrypoints backed by Redis.
- Dependency injection with `diwire` and explicit application boundaries.
- Local Docker Compose for PostgreSQL, PgBouncer, Redis, and optional MinIO.
- Storage choices for local files, local MinIO, or remote S3-compatible services.
- Strict linting, typing, architecture guardrails, and pytest coverage.

## Architecture

The main rule is deliberately simple:

```text
Controller -> Use Case / Service -> Model
```

Controllers handle FastAPI, Django, or Celery delivery concerns. Use cases and
services own application behavior, ORM access, and transaction boundaries.
Transactions use the injected `TransactionFactory`; delivery code does not call
Django models directly.

The source layout follows that rule:

- `src/modern_python_template/core/` - domains, models, DTOs, use cases, services, and delivery.
- `src/modern_python_template/foundation/` - shared base contracts.
- `src/modern_python_template/entrypoints/` - FastAPI, Django, and Celery composition roots.
- `src/modern_python_template/infrastructure/` - framework and external-system integration.
- `src/modern_python_template/ioc/` - dependency injection container setup.
- `management/` - repository management commands.
