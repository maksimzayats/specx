# Fast Django

A FastAPI + Django + Celery project template with a setup wizard, dependency
injection, typed settings, and practical architecture guardrails.

## Why Fast Django?

Fast Django gives you a backend template that can be cloned and customized
quickly without losing a clear application structure:

- **Django** for ORM, admin panel, and authentication
- **FastAPI** for high-performance REST APIs
- **Celery** for background task processing
- **diwire** for dependency injection
- **Pydantic** for validation and settings management
- **Logfire** for observability (OpenTelemetry-based)

## Start With Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MaksimZayats/fastdjango.git my-api
cd my-api
make setup
```

The wizard renames the project, writes `.env`, configures database, Redis,
storage, docs, public origins, and Logfire defaults, then prints the next
commands for the choices you made.

## Key Features

- **Use Case / Service Layer Architecture**: Clean separation between delivery and database operations
- **Auto-Registration IoC**: Minimal boilerplate dependency injection with automatic wiring
- **Type Safety**: Full `mypy --strict` compatibility with Python 3.14+
- **Test Isolation**: Per-test container instances with easy mocking
- **Unified Controller Pattern**: Same pattern for HTTP endpoints, Django delivery, and Celery tasks

## The Golden Rule

This template enforces a strict architectural boundary:

```
Controller → Use Case / Service → Model

✅ Controller calls a use case or service
✅ Use cases and services own ORM access
❌ Controller queries models directly
```

Controllers handle FastAPI, Django, and Celery delivery concerns. Use cases and
services contain application logic and database operations. Models define data
structures.

## Requirements

- Python 3.14+
- uv (Python package manager)
- Docker and Docker Compose for local infrastructure choices
