## Core

Core is organized as vertical business modules. Inner application code lives
directly under each business package: entities, DTOs, repository interfaces,
services, use cases, and exceptions. Those inner modules do not import FastAPI,
SQLAlchemy, local infrastructure, delivery modules, or the container.

## Local Adapters

Delivery schemas and controllers live under each business package's
`delivery/fastapi` directory. Concrete SQLAlchemy models, mappers, and
repository implementations live under each business package's
`infrastructure/sqlalchemy` directory.

## Shared Infrastructure

`infrastructure/database` builds the SQLAlchemy base, metadata, engine/session
factory, and unit-of-work transaction wiring. Application decisions stay in
core use cases and services; SQLAlchemy query work stays in local repository
adapter implementations.

## Entrypoints

`entrypoints/fastapi` builds the FastAPI application, adds middleware,
instruments telemetry, and registers domain controllers.
